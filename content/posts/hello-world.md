It looks like I've undertaken yet another attempt to run my own blog. I am going to _try_ to chronicle interesting issues I'll be approaching (and _hopefully_ solving) during the time I work as a programmer. Therefore: <!--more--> 

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print('Hello, world!')
```

Psst! If you want to know the real reason, why this page exists - I'm just testing _Hugo_, _Travis CI_ and _Github pages_ integration (following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/how-to-create-a-website-like-freshswift-net-using-hugo-travis-ci-and-github-pages-67be6f480298), and it's just an acceptable (or even _gratifying_) side-effect.
